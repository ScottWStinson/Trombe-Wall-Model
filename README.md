# Trombe-Wall-Model
This is MATLAB program created to simulate the temperature distribution of a Trombe Wall given normal weather conditions in Norfolk, VA.

To run program, add weather2.xlsx containing weather data and trombecode.m to your chosen directory. Run the trombecode.m file in MATLAB and it will ask for the number of days to run the simulation. Type in the number of days and press enter.

This is the output from the MATLAB code I wrote using the explicit method. We were given weather data(temperatures) from the city our school is located in, and used that to model a Trombe wall, which is made up of cement, air, and glass, and compare the outer wall heat flux(T6) to the inner wall (T0), and as we can see the outer wall fluctuates very much, as the inner wall doesnâ€™t. This wall design is to keep the inside warm during cold days.

You should get an output that looks similar to this, one may edit the excel spreadsheet for your particular area.
